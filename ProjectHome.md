<strong>Game Description:</strong><br>
Our game is a simplified version of Risk, the well-known board game.<br>
<br>
Risk is a turn-based game for two or more players. The game is played on a predefined 2-dimensional world map with a specified number of territories.<br>
At the beginning of the game the territories are randomly divided amongst the players with a random number of soldiers.<br>
During a player's turn, he may choose to launch an attack from one of his territories to an adjacent territory. The outcome of the attack is determined by rolling dice.<br>
A player wins the game by gaining control of all the territories.<br>
